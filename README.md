# Design and Documentation

## Problem definition
Parking is ridiculously overpriced and under-supplied during peak times. Most car owners become frustrated with the expenses being paid for car parking or the inconvenience of not being able to drive and park where they need to, when they need.

## Solution
With so much real estate going un-used when you're at work or over the weekend, we've created a sharing marketplace to allow owners to advertise their available parking spaces and for users to make appropriate bookings for these parking spaces.

## User Journey

### Parking User
Discovery -> Sign up -> Search for parking -> Book -> Pay
-> Park

### Space Owner
Discovery -> Sign up -> Create parking space listing -> Provide booking users with directions and instructions for parking space -> Accept payment -> Keep in touch with booking users

## Deliverables
- Wireframes:

- User Stories:

- Entity Relationship Diagram
